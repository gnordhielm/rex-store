## Guides

**Emulating Mobile in the Browser**

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Hit `option` + `command` + `j`.
3. A little shelf will pop up. Look up in the top left.
4. Click the phone/tablet icon. It's the one second over from the left.
5. The browser part of the window will shrink to mobile size, your cursor will become a circle (like a finger!).
6. At the top of the browser part of the window, there's a dropdown where you can select what phone model you want to emulate.
7. If you want to go back to the normal view, just click the same button that popped you into this view.
8. You can close the shelf with `option` + `command` + `j` - or there's a little "x" at the top right.
